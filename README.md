# Building a Generic Utility Library in TypeScript
This was an assigment for my Mobile Application Development class. 

Objective: "Understand and apply TypeScript generics to create a utility library that provides functions for array and object manipulation, demonstrating the versatility and type safety of generics."

To execute: Assuming that Node and TypeScript are already a part of your IDE, running "node genericUtil.js" within your terminal should run the application, showcasing the test cases and their output.
Any changes made to the genericUtil.tsx file will require you to recompile the application once again in order to run the .js file with the recent changes.
